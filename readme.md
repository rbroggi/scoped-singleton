### Context - structured logging in transaction info

### Convenience of use 

### Resilient to different flows controls (send log data for early-terminated methods)

### One single network rpc per transaction - network optimization

### Shortcomings 
1. mind your scope: long-living reference
2. mind your scope: no anchor
